/**
 * Decoding the beacon:
 * This was done through reverse engineering. Hopefully it's correct.
 * - The beacon coming from a pair of AirPods/Beats contains a manufacturer specific data field nÂ°76 of 27 bytes
 * - We convert this data to a hexadecimal string
 * - The 12th and 13th characters in the string represent the charge of the left and right pods.
 * Under unknown circumstances[1], they are right and left instead (see isFlipped). Values between 0 and 10 are battery 0-100%; Value 15 means it's disconnected
 * - The 15th character in the string represents the charge of the case. Values between 0 and 10 are battery 0-100%; Value 15 means it's disconnected
 * - The 14th character in the string represents the "in charge" status.
 * Bit 0 (LSB) is the left pod; Bit 1 is the right pod; Bit 2 is the case. Bit 3 might be case open/closed but I'm not sure and it's not used
 * - The 11th character in the string represents the in-ear detection status. Bit 1 is the left pod; Bit 3 is the right pod.
 * - The 7th character in the string represents the model
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1) - isFlipped set by bit 1 of 10th character in the string; seems to be related to in-ear detection;
